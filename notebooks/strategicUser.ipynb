    "In our [previous notebook](https://github.com/barnabemonnot/abm1559/blob/master/notebooks/stationary1559.ipynb), we simulated users interacting with the EIP 1559 transaction fee market mechanism for inclusion. Our users were strategic to some extent: they observed the prevailing basefee, evaluated their values and costs and decided whether to send a transaction or not. We saw that once the system reaches stationarity, users who aren't deterred by the basefee can expect next-block inclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We made one big assumption there, which is that users respect the commonly stated heuristic of setting their premiums (in general, what the miner receives from the transaction) at a fixed value compensating the miner for the extra work of including one extra transaction. In this notebook, we relax this assumption and look at what happens when users bid strategically, trying to outcompete each other in transitionary periods, before the basefee settles.\n",

To this, we subtract the fee Alice must pay for inclusion, or _gas price_. Assuming the basefee currently sits at 10 Gwei/gas and Alice set her premium at 1 Gwei/gas, her total gas price is 11 Gwei/gas. Her final payoff is then 12.5 - 11 = 1.5 Gwei/gas. In other words:\n",

    "In the chart above, between blocks 0 and 26, before basefee reaches its apex, strategic users are included in much higher proportions than non-strategic users. Not surprising, since they post higher premiums. More surprising however is that this proportion is decreasing, until it is reversed: by block 20, more non-strategic users are included than strategic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is trickier to explain but we can sketch the following narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Most users, both strategic and non-strategic, have valid transactions (for which the cap is above the basefee) to send. Strategic users get in first and take all the slots. In particular, _low-valued_ strategic users get in before _high-valued_ non-strategic users.\n",
    "2. Users start being discriminated by the basefee. Strategic users with valid transactions get in, some non-strategic users get in too.\n",
    "3. Basefee keeps increasing. _High-valued_ non-strategic users which were languishing in the pool start filling the block, while most new, _low-valued_ strategic users are priced out.\n",
    "4. Basefee hits highest level. No one gets in.\n",
    "5. Basefee starts decreasing. Valid leftovers in the pool (almost all of them non-strategic) are included with some of the new users.\n",
    "6. Basefee stabilises. Only new users are included, no one in the pool is valid anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected to find this instability during transitionary periods, where the basefee needs to adapt to a changing demand, e.g., a spike in transactions or higher values for transacting. We find however that once the basefee settles, strategic users no longer have the edge over nonstrategic ones: the basefee is the true determinant for inclusion."

    "## (Bonus) Cancel culture\n",
    "\n",
    "We now allow users to cancel their transactions. We discussed in the previous notebook's bonus section the concept of _ex post individual rationality_. Suppose I estimate that should my transaction be included within 5 blocks, my payoff will be positive. In this case, I decide to join the pool and send my transaction. Fierce competition during transitionary periods however might prevent me from being included when I thought I would be. Without the ability to cancel my transaction, I must stick around in the transaction pool and could net a negative payoff once I am included.\n",
    "\n",
    "We add here the possibility for users to cancel their transaction. Cancelling is not completely trivial in the current, first-price auction paradigm (see [Etherscan's helpful guide for an overview](https://info.etherscan.com/how-to-cancel-ethereum-pending-transactions/)). To cancel transaction A, the trick is to send another transaction B with the same nonce (your address's \"transaction counter\") with a slightly higher fee. Miners with access to both A and B in their pool will strictly prefer B and _cannot_ include both.\n",
    "\n",
    "With EIP 1559, we'll assume users send a new transaction with a slightly higher premium. We also assumed that miners keep around an extensible list of pending transactions, even those rendered invalid from a high basefee, in case the basefee decreases. So we'll assume that as soon as a user sends a replacement transaction to cancel its original transaction, the original transaction disappears from the mempool. The costs to users vary according to the outcome:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In case the original and replacement transactions have a low gas price such that neither are ever included in a block, the user cancels \"for free\".\n",
    "- On the other hand, when the replacement transaction is included, the user incurs a cost. It is rational to cancel whenever the payoff from cancelling the transaction is greater than the payoff from inclusion. Suppose the replacement transaction posts a premium equal to $p'$ (gas price = $g'$), while the original transaction's is $p$ (gas price = $g$). Cancelling yields a payoff of $-g'$, while being included yields $v - w . c - g$, where $v$ is the value, $c$ is the cost for waiting per block and $w$ is the time waited. It is rational to cancel whenever:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v - w . c - g < -g' $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, $g$ and $g'$ both depend on the current basefee, which complicates the matter. To simplify here, we assume that as soon as the current value $v - w . c$ of the user becomes negative, the user cancels their transaction."
